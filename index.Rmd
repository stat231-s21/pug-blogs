          "The Covid-19 pandemic continues to highlight inequality in health outcomes in the United States.  As of April 23rd, 2021, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html#footnote02) reports that Hispanic, Black, and American Indian or Alaska Native people are more likely to test positive for, be hospitalized for, and die from Covid-19 when compared to White, non-Hispanic people.  Considering these disparities alongside recent developments in vaccine distribution, we became curious as to how race and ethnicity relate to immunization rates in each state."
          #vivavious vaxxers
          , "For our final project, we will not be building upon our mid-semester project, but instead looking at the social impacts of the pandemic specifically on Asian- and Black-American populations. Through our mid semester project we realized that the current available data surrounding vaccinations isn't all that great; however, we still wanted to focus on COVID and the sociopolitical effects of the pandemic which have a multitude of public health implications. Additionally, this past year has brought the prevalence of anti-Black and anti-Asian hate crimes and violence to the forefront of many American minds. This issue is not just a social one but greatly impacts health, and as of early April, [the CDC has declared racism](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0408-racism-health.html) as a threat to public health."
          # girls who code
          , "While COVID has affected almost everyone in the US and around the world, it is clear that the pandemic’s impact has not been felt equally. Americans of lower socioeconomic status before the pandemic have been disproportionately impacted by unemployment, food and housing insecurity, and health issues in the past year. As economic recovery policies are being created and implemented, it is important to know how measures like stimulus packages should be targeted to help those who have dealt with the most extreme impacts of COVID-19. In order to help serve this need, this project explores how different demographic and economic health variables can predict a variety of impacts of the pandemic."
          #library cleanverse
          , "It’s no secret that COVID-19 has dramatically changed our lives over the course of the past year. It’s only recently, as vaccines have started to become available, that society has begun to return to normal.<br> When we sat down to discuss what to study, we were all drawn to the dramatic impact of vaccinations. And although different aspects of the issue, ranging from differential state effects, to political correlations, to adaptations over time, caught our attention, it was clear that we wanted to study vaccination data. We thought we’d turn to the United States, as our previous project had a more international focus."

          , "This blog analyzes the impact of differential access to drinking water around the world. As water is critical to our survival, water access affects nearly all parts of human life – including life expectancy, socioeconomic status, health and nutrition, and much more. With endless issues to study surrounding water access, we focus our blog on a few key interests of ours, including how water access levels relate to educational outcomes and economic development levels, as well as how social media are used as a tool for clean water advocacy."
          # wrangle this messi data
          , "For more than one hundred years, baseball has been a numbers game. We currently have access to hundreds of thousands of statistics dating back to the 1800s, presenting the rare opportunity to compare a slugger like Babe Ruth (a pitcher and hitter during the roaring ‘20s) to Mike Trout (the best ball-player today). In 2015, however, the MLB introduced a new method to track statistics: Statcast."

          , "Basketball is a sport that is continuously evolving. Since its invention, there have been many changes in both the rules and the style of play. Over the past decade, the league has undergone a rapid change due to both the increase in the use of analytics and changes in officiating . . . This blog will use two methods to observe the shift in strategy over the course of the history of the NBA. The first is to analyze shot location data, where the trend in the different locations where players shoot the ball are tracked since the 2010-2011 season. The second is by comparing present-day seasons to historical seasons."
          # team basketball
          , "So much of a positive career is determined by the circumstances surrounding it. Maybe you got the job because you were in the right place at the right time, or you missed the interview because of a flat tire and didn’t get the job. For players in the National Basketball Association, these circumstances are often experienced as what schools they attended and teams were they traded to. With this project we set out to discover if the circumstances around who players wore across their chests impacted overall career success. Did players that knew more players than others have more successful careers? Is connection early on in a basketball player’s journey - say high school or college - more indicative of a successful career?"
          # election pundits
          , "The United States presidential election is one of the most followed political events in the world. As such, there are many who study the data involved in the hopes of both making predictions and informing the public on the current state of the election. In this blog post, we share our analysis of data from a key component of the election process: speeches given by the candidates. In particular, we analyzed text from speeches given by Joe Biden and Donald Trump during the lead up to the 2020 election."
          # nate platinum, sarah
          , "We live in a world where money and politics are largely intertwined. This fact is starkly apparent when examining the net worth of certain 2020 presidential candidates. Michael Bloomberg, who has a net worth of $59 billion, spent over $1 billion on his own candidacy. Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager and billionaire, also made a run for President. The 45th President, Donald Trump, made a fortune through his real estate empire, allocating millions to his campaign. The 2020 election, including both presidential and congressional races, cost a record-breaking $14 billion. Aside from candidates’ own wealth, where is the rest of this campaign money coming from?"

          , "Research out of the University of Arizona suggests that one in three species are likely to be extinct by the end of the century (article [here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/21/weather/species-extinction-climate-trnd/index.html)), in large part due to human activities. Conservation efforts are underway across the globe, but what we are currently doing is not enough. The goal of this blog post is to illustrate where the greatest biodiversity in the world exists, where conservation funding is being concentrated, and where animal trade is occurring, in an attempt to reveal where we are centering our conservation efforts and where we perhaps should be. In the process, we encounter current problems with species data collection and consider possible solutions."
          # the naturers
          , "With climate change being one of the most pressing issues of our generation, finding ways to combat this enormous problem is going to require a bunch of system level changes all happening at the same time in order to mitigate the negative effects. Currently one of the biggest transformations that is going to be required to reduce the total amount of carbon emissions, especially here within the United States, is finding a way to transition the country towards renewable energy and cutting back on fossil fuels."
          # ava
          , "Back in March, I created my PUG Shiny project with a focus on COVID vaccine distribution. At the time, the issue facing the united states was primarily one of distribution: people who wanted the vaccine couldn’t get it. Eligibility was restricted state by state to allocate a precious resource. Even people who were eligible needed to get lucky and navigate online sign up forms, vouching for fewer spots than people . . . Over the past six weeks, the supply chain has greatly improved, and access is no longer such a pressing issue. The issues facing the country have evolved: the issue now is acheiving heard immunity, and getting everyone vaccinated. In March, I didn’t know anyone who had gotten a vaccine. But now in April, I don’t know anyone who hasn’t gotten one. I wanted to map out where in the country people are the most hesitant to get vaccinated. Knowing the most resistant geographies could be useful information for government organizations to focus their vaccine advocacy efforts.")
